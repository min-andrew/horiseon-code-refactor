# Horiseon-code-refactor

Refactored the source code to include assessibility, and optimized the CSS to match. 

## Description

With Horiseon's source code, we optimized the code to meet accessibility standards. I have added semantic HTML elements, built a logical structure to the HTML elements, added alt attributes to the image elements, and included a concise, descriptive title.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Windows 10 or the latest Mac OS.

## Help

Note: this layout is designed for "desktop", so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the Mock-Up when viewed at a resolution smaller than 768px.
